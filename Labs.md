## Overview

The table below lists all capabilties that we currently have labs for. A capability may contain one or more labs depending on the complexity. It is recommended that during the Jam, you prioritize the capabilties that you are interested in and the ones that depend on the Jam infrastructure.

To earn a badge for a specific capability, you must complete all labs for it and answer the quiz linked in the table below.
